                Mark Elliot Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York to psychiatrist Karen (n√©e Kempner) and dentist Edward Zuckerberg. 
                He and his three sisters (Arielle, Randi, and Donna) were raised in a Reform Jewish household in Dobbs Ferry, New York. His great-grandparents 
                were emigrants from Austria, Germany, and Poland. Zuckerberg initially attended Ardsley High School before transferring to Phillips Exeter Academy. 
                He was captain of the fencing team.

            <h2 style="padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 20px;">Software Development</h2>
            <p>
                Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. In high school, he built a program that allowed all the computers between 
                his house and his father's dental office to communicate with each other. During Zuckerberg's high-school years, he worked to build a music player 
                called the Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to Slashdot and received 
                a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine. The New Yorker once said of Zuckerberg: "some kids played computer games. Mark created them." While still 
                in high school, he attended Mercy College taking a graduate computer course on Thursday evenings.

            <h2 style="padding-top: 50px; padding-bottom: 20px;">College Years</h2>
            <p>
                The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard in 2002, he had already achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy". 
                He studied psychology and computer science, resided in Kirkland House, and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi. In his second year, he wrote a program that 
                he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and help them form study groups. 
                Later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. Arie Hasit, 
                Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, explained: <br> <br>

                We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed 
                two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would be a ranking. <br> <br>

                The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches 
                preventing students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized 
                publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was "completely improper".
